pksh, the Packet Shell

<preface>

If you are impatient and not interested in the full story,
here is the download button:

   git clone https://github.com/rcarbone/pksh.git

Please, make sure you have the autotools installed before to attempt to compile.

   1> cd pksh

   2> ./configure

   3> sudo shell/pksh

      Warning:
        You need super-user permissions to run the shell because
        sniffing from a network interface is a privileged operation.
